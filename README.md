# GMod-Web-Administrator-Plugin
A web-based administration plugin for server owners!



Installation

- Open the WEB folder in the .zip downloaded, extract this to your web host in the directory you want it installed!
- Open up the config.php file, edit the top database settings only, there is no need to setup tables yourself as my script does it for you!!! :D
- Once saved and re-uploaded, navigate to yourdomain.com/yourdirectory/install.php
- Upon success, you will be greated with a message that informs you to delete the install.php file. This means it has worked!
- Now you can safely navigate to your main directory where index.php is located and login using default values Username: root Password: root

Game Server Setup

- Upload the contents of your GAME folder in the .zip you downloaded into your addons folder.
- Navigate to _freds_admin/lua/autorun/server/sv_fredsadmin.lua and open it
- Change the MySQL database details to match those of your web file's
- Save the file, upload it.
- You need to have the MySQL Pre-requisites installed for Garry's Mod 13, you can download that here
- You are all set! Give it a shot, get some support in the comments below I will check this as often as I can depending on how busy I am!!!
